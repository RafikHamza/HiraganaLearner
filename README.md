# HiraganaLearner

This is a project to learn Hiragana, built with React, Vite, and Node.js.

## Getting Started on GitHub

Follow these steps to put this project onto your GitHub account and prepare it for potential deployment.

### 1. Initialize a Git Repository

If you haven't already, initialize a Git repository in your project root directory:

```bash
git init
```

### 2. Add Your Files

Stage all your project files for the first commit:

```bash
git add .
```

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Create your first commit with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### 4. Create a Repository on GitHub

Go to GitHub (github.com) and create a new empty repository. **Do NOT initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license**, as your project already has these or you will add them from your local copy.

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you instructions. You will need the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git`).

### 5. Link Local and Remote Repositories

Add the GitHub repository as a remote origin to your local Git repository. Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL` with the URL you got from GitHub:

```bash
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
```

### 6. Push to GitHub

Push your local commits to the GitHub repository:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

(Note: The default branch name might be `master` instead of `main` depending on your Git configuration. Adjust the command if necessary.)

Now your project code should be on GitHub!
